# Project Name

**Author**:  Julie Erlemeier, Zerek Cover and Jon Veach
**Version**:  1.0.1

## Overview
This application will be for you to search for your favorite books by title or author and display them along with brief information about each book in a clean and easy to understand interface.

## Getting Started
To run this application on your server, you must first install Node on your computer, then clone this repo to your computer and run `npm install -S` to install the node dependancies.  After those are installed, do `node start server.js` or `nodemon` if you have nodemon installed.  After successfully starting the server, open a new web browser and enter in `localhost:3000` in the browser and hit enter.

## Architecture
This application utilizes express, ejs and superagent.

## Change Log
Version 1.0.0 - Base line version where the server successfully came online.  
Version 1.0.1 - Updated version to successfully render data pulled from Google Books API and display it to a second page in clean format.

## Credits and Collaberations
Credits to Google, Dan, Nicholas and Lena.  Also credits to the Seattle Center Park for the relaxing view and, above all, God.  Because with God, we'd be stuck in Regex hell.
